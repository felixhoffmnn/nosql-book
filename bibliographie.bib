It covers everything from data grids to the simple-to-use distributed data storage collections. Queuing and topic messaging capabilities, as well as locking and transaction support to guard against concurrency race-conditions, are some of the topics that we will cover. We will then move on to distributed task execution, in-place data manipulations and big data analytical processing using MapReduce. At the end of all this, you will be armed with everything you need to bring amazing power and data scalability to your applications, as well as making them truly global and ready for a worldwide audience.},

The differentiation between the two databases will be based on the results or output obtained from the YCSB tests. As these NoSQL databases are supposed to offer increased performance and availability in comparison to the traditional databases, the results will allow us to evident this claims. Along with that, it will also allow to distinguish between the two chosen NoSQL databases on the basis of the performance evaluation parameters used in the tests. The evaluation parameters take a note of the results from the CRUD operations to be executed on the selected workloads, for both the databases. On the basis of the obtained output, the efficiency of the compared databases can be interpreted. This will further help to attain any performance related issues appearing in any of the evaluated databases.},
